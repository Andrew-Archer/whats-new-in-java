# What's new in Java

This project demonstrates new features introduced in different versions of Java (SE). It focuses only on those features that are visible to application developers and may affect the style or approaches to programming in Java. (Re)moving of existing APIs is not considered here at all.

The project is based on Maven and has a classic multi-modular structure. Each module focuses on a specific version of the language. All examples are located in **test** folders.

It's in the phase of the active development now. You can help to add some new information with examples by doing a pull request from your fork.
